Hello and welcome to my game 'Space Salvage Squad'

How to play:
- Travel through portals in each level to leave space and travel back to earth
- Explore the map
- Find the shop to purchase items
- Each spaceship has stats attached to them:
	- Speed: Speed that astronaut moves 
	- Durability: Strength of spaceship 
	- Capacity: Biggest backpack space to store coins

Level 1:
- If you run out of durability in level 1 you die
- Every time you try to teleport, your ship loses durability 
- When you lose boss fight (aka robot shop master) durability goes down as well
- Timer when your ship loses all of its durability (30 seconds to replenish)
- There is a % chance that you buy the correct key each time that you buy a key

Level 2:
- Your ships durability now represents how much oxygen you have as an astronaut.
- Your new goal is to mine enough crystals to fix the portal door!
- Good luck 

Level 3:
In Progress
